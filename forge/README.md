# Forge Subproject

This is where all forge specific code and resources go. Generally I find that not too much goes in here besides the entrypoints, metadata, and occasional loader specific implementation.

As usual you'll find the code and resources in `src/` and the subproject gradle build file, build.gradle`

There's also `gradle.properties` in here, but that's just for some loom thing. You'll likely only use the root project `gradle.properties`.
