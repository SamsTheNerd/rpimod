# Fabric Subproject

This is where all fabric specific code and resources go. Generally I find that not too much goes in here besides the entrypoints, metadata, and occasional loader specific implementation.

As usual you'll find the code and resources in `src/` and the subproject gradle build file, build.gradle`
